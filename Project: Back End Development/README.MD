## Project in Back End development (DATA ANALYST & DATA ENGINEER)

This project is to show my coding skills and my knowledge of Python and SQL Programming. 
I'll add some features to this REPO when I have the knowledge to do.


<h2> CSV FILES </h2> 

The CSV cars-data file is from <a href="https://github.com/rashida048/Datasets/blob/master/cars.csv">this REPO</a> 

The CSV customers-data file was generated by <a href="https://generatedata.com/generator"> this website</a>


<h2> SQL FILES </h2>

The CARS.SQL file is a syntax text to config my SQL DB, I prefer to use the terminal to manage the DB, so I use an SQL file to have a better idea of ​​what I'm programming.
I always will disponibilize the dump of DB to be more useful


<h2> Python FILES </h2>

The Python files are to create charts and analyze the data from my SQL, I had another thing for it in mind to put in the future but I don't know how to put it into practice.


<h2>SHELL FILES</h2>

The shell files will make the system interface and the Insert functions, I want to build a system to show customers and majors from enterprises.
